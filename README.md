# Plant-Wide-Models

This repository contains the different implementations of the plant-wide models developed between [Lund University](https://www.iea.lth.se/) and [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/english/research/prosys).  

<strong>1. BSM2 with decay modifications and reactive settler </strong>  

The Main developers are: [Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina), [Ramesh Saagi](https://github.com/rsaagi), Krist V. Gernaey and [Ulf Jeppsson](https://github.com/ulfjeppsson). The model is described in the following paper: 

[Flores-Alsina, X., Gernaey, K. V., & Jeppsson, U. (2012). Benchmarking biological nutrient removal in wastewater treatment plants: Influence of mathematical model assumptions. Water Science and Technology, 65(8), 1496–1505.](https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2012.039).


This version of the model is adapated to be run in Matlab 2019b (or newer).
