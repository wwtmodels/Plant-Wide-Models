# Plant-Wide-Models

This repository contains the different implementations of the plant-wide models developed between [Lund University](https://www.iea.lth.se/) and [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/english/research/prosys).  

<strong>1. BSM2 with ion activity corrections </strong>  

The Main developers are: Kimberly Solon, [Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina), Damien Batstone, Krist V. Gernaey and [Ulf Jeppsson](https://github.com/ulfjeppsson). The model is described in the following paper: 

[Solon, K., Flores-Alsina, X., Mbamba, C. K., Volcke, E. I. P., Tait, S., Batstone, D., Gernaey, K. V., & Jeppsson, U. (2015). Effects of ionic strength and ion pairing on (plant-wide) modelling of anaerobic digestion. Water Research, 70, 235–245.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2014.11.035). 

This version of the model is adapated to be run in Matlab 2019b (or newer).

<strong>2. BSM2 with decay modifications and reactive settler </strong>  

The Main developers are: [Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina), [Ramesh Saagi](https://github.com/rsaagi), Krist V. Gernaey and [Ulf Jeppsson](https://github.com/ulfjeppsson). The model is described in the following paper:

This version of the model is adapated to be run in Matlab 2019b (or newer).
